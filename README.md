# tic-tac-toe


## Purpose

Tutorial project to put in practice several topics I wanted to make tests

### Topics

- Test Drive Development: Follow the tutorials of the Ray Wenderlich's Book “iOS Test-Driven Development by Tutorials”
- Core Animation: use animations in SwiftUI

### Roadmap

- First craft TicTacToe basic logic with TDD
- Then try to create a simple interface in SwiftUI to play (using same device) 
- Add simple animations
- More advanced animations showing the game tree of plays using backtracking
- Expand the TicTacToe to be NxN, trying to play with the dimension to see how much the iPhone can handle.
- Expand TicTacToe to be 3D, 3x3x3
- Repeat simple and advanced animations
- Add the ability to play with another person
- Add basic heuristic to computer play (min max)
